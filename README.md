This Pomodoro Timer app is a productivity tool that helps you manage your time and tasks effectively by following the Pomodoro Technique. The app divides your work into focused intervals of 25 minutes, followed by short breaks, and then a longer break after completing four Pomodoro intervals.

# Features

- 25-Minute Focus Timer: The app sets a timer for 25 minutes to help you focus on a task.
- Short Breaks: After each 25-minute work session, the app prompts a short break (5-10 minutes).
- Long Break: After completing four Pomodoros, the app gives you a longer break (15-20 minutes).
- Progress Bar: A visual progress bar helps track how much time remains in the current Pomodoro session.
- Pomodoro Counter: Displays the number of Pomodoros completed to keep you motivated.

# How It Works
- Start the Timer: Click the "Start" button to begin your Pomodoro session. The timer will start counting down from 25 minutes.
- Focus on the Task: Work on your task until the timer chimes. The progress bar will fill up as you get closer to completing your Pomodoro session.
- Short Break: After 25 minutes, the timer will chime, and you'll take a short break of 5 minutes. This helps refresh your mind before the next work session.
- Repeat: After four Pomodoro sessions, the app will prompt a longer break of 15 minutes to recharge.
- Pomodoro Tracking: The app keeps track of how many Pomodoros you've completed, displayed below the timer.

# Code Overview
- HTML: The HTML file provides the structure of the app, including the timer display, progress bar, and buttons.
- CSS: The CSS file gives the app a simple, calming design, with a minimalist color scheme to reduce distractions.
- JavaScript: The core logic of the Pomodoro timer is handled using JavaScript. It uses setInterval to manage the countdown for the work sessions and breaks. The app updates the progress bar and tracks Pomodoro completion through JavaScript functions.
